            <h1> A little about him </h1>
            <p>
                Michael Caine is one of the most beloved actors in history. From Alfie to Alfred, his career has spanned
                eight decades, and he’s racked up more accolades than we can count. But Hollywood’s most charming
                Cockney has a surprisingly dark history. He’s been locked in a cupboard for a weekend, strapped to a bed
                for days, and experienced a very unusual dinner date with Peter O’Toole—and that’s just the tip of the
                iceberg.

                everything they could to give their son a good life—but they often had to resort to desperate measures.

            <h1> His father did what he had to do </h1>
            <p> Caine’s mother worked as a cook/housekeeper, while his father made his living lugging fish around at the
                Billingsgate fish market. He came home reeking of fish every day, but at least his job meant the
                Micklewhites never went hungry. Whenever funds got too tight, Caine’s father would swipe fish from the
                market and bring it home for dinner.

                As Caine put it, “By the time I was 15 I never wanted to see fish again.” But soon, too much fish would
                be the least of his problems… </p>
